I am a conservation ecologist with broad research interests encompassing long term studies in population dynamics and life history, biodiversity monitoring and conservation as well as evolutionary and behavioural ecology. Furthermore I have a strong interest in the development and application of novel quantitative tools in ecology and evolutionary biology and in particular in methods for causal inference from observational ecological data. 
  
I joined the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Chester in August 2015 after having worked for 10 years as a research biologist for the Gran Paradiso National Park (GPNP, Northwestern Italian Alps) where I was in charge of long term ecological research and conservation projects. In 2009-10 I took a year off my job at GPNP to work as a postdoc visiting researcher at the National Centre for Statistical Ecology (University of Kent, UK). Previously, I obtained my PhD from the University of Sherbrooke (Canada) in 2005 and a Degree in Biological Sciences (BSc + MSc) in 1998 from the University of Pavia (Italy).
